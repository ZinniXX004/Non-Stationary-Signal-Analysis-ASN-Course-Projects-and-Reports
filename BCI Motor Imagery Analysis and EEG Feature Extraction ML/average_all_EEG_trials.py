average_all_EEG_trials.py (REVISED v3.0)

Purpose:
    - Segment continuous squared EEG data into "Epochs" based on Event markers.
    - Perform Synchronous Averaging to enhance Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR).
    - Separate trials by Class: Left Hand (769) vs. Right Hand (770).
    - Preserves Multi-Channel Integrity (C3, Cz, C4) for feature extraction.

Dependencies:
    - numpy
    - matplotlib (for standalone testing)

        "2. THE PROBLEM:\n"
        "   - A single EEG trial is dominated by noise (SNR << 1).\n"
        "   - The motor cortex response is weak compared to background activity.\n\n"
        "3. THE SOLUTION (Averaging):\n"
        "   - Assumption: Noise is random (zero mean), while the ERD signal is time-locked.\n"
        "   - By summing N trials, the Signal amplitude increases by N, while Noise by sqrt(N).\n"
        "   - Result: SNR improves by a factor of sqrt(N).\n\n"
        "4. PROCEDURE:\n"
        "   - Cut data segments (Epochs) from T_min to T_max around each cue.\n"
        "   - Separate Epochs into Class 1 (Left Hand) and Class 2 (Right Hand).\n"
